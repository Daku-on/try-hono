# Getting Started with Hono 🔥

Hono (which means "flame" in Japanese) is a small, simple, and ultrafast web framework built on Web Standards. It works on any JavaScript runtime: Cloudflare Workers, Fastly Compute, Deno, Bun, Vercel, Netlify, AWS Lambda, Lambda@Edge, and Node.js.

## Why Choose Hono?

### ⚡ Ultra Fast
Hono uses RegExpRouter which provides exceptional routing performance. In benchmarks, it often outperforms other popular frameworks by significant margins.

### 🪶 Lightweight  
The core framework is incredibly lightweight. The `hono/tiny` preset is under 14kB, making it perfect for edge computing environments.

### 🌐 Web Standards
Built on Web Standards, Hono works seamlessly across multiple JavaScript runtimes without modification.

## Basic Example

```javascript
import { Hono } from 'hono'

const app = new Hono()

app.get('/', (c) => {
  return c.text('Hello Hono!')
})

app.get('/json', (c) => {
  return c.json({ message: 'Hello from Hono!' })
})

export default app
```

## Middleware Power

Hono comes with a rich ecosystem of middleware:

- **Built-in middleware**: CORS, JWT, Basic Auth, etc.
- **Third-party middleware**: Extensive community ecosystem
- **Custom middleware**: Easy to create your own

```javascript
import { cors } from 'hono/cors'
import { jwt } from 'hono/jwt'

app.use('*', cors())
app.use('/api/*', jwt({ secret: 'your-secret' }))
```

## Deployment Flexibility

One of Hono's greatest strengths is its deployment flexibility:

- **Cloudflare Workers**: Perfect for edge computing
- **Node.js**: Traditional server deployment
- **Deno**: Modern JavaScript runtime
- **Bun**: Ultra-fast JavaScript runtime
- **Vercel/Netlify**: Serverless functions

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the basics, try building your own Hono application! The framework's simplicity and performance make it an excellent choice for modern web development.

Happy coding! 🔥
